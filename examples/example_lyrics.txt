[Verse 1]
Morning coffee, half awake
Inbox full before I breathe
Every street’s a moving line
Everybody’s somewhere they need to be

I hold it together just enough
Smile when I pass the day
But my shoulders only drop
When I’m walking your way

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s not loud, it’s not a spark
It’s the quiet when I get close

[Chorus]
When I’m near you
The noise falls off
Like I finally clocked out
Of the world I fought

Nothing rushes
Nothing proves
I don’t have to be more
I just get to be here with you

[Verse 2]
Long days leave a mark
Even when I don’t say it out loud
I’ve learned not to fix the weight
Just let it settle, let it slow down

I’ve chased the highs, I’ve played my part
Tried to outrun the blue
But peace feels different now
It feels steady next to you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don’t need the night to promise me more
I already know the floor won’t move

[Chorus]
When I’m near you
Everything shifts
Like the room remembers
How to exist

No big moment
No grand truth
Just the ease of knowing
I belong here with you

[Bridge]
I’ve been everywhere I was supposed to be
Still searching for something solid
Turns out peace isn’t empty space
It’s being fully grounded

[Final Chorus]
When I’m near you
I don’t perform
I don’t brace for impact
I don’t keep score

There’s a quiet happiness
That doesn’t fade
Just a subtle smile
Knowing I’m safe
Knowing I stayed
