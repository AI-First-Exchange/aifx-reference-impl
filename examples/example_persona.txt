Mira

Modern jazz-pop with soulful lo-fi influence. Warm Rhodes piano, soft upright or muted bass, brushed drums, subtle vinyl texture. Slow to mid-slow tempo (76–80 BPM). Minimalist, spacious arrangement with a late-night coffeehouse feel.

Female vocal, late-20s to early-30s tone — soulful, husky, warm low-mid register. Close-mic, intimate, breathy delivery with slight rasp on emotional words. Conversational phrasing, restrained and confident. No belting, no vocal runs, no exaggerated vibrato.

Calm, grounded, quietly intimate mood. Modern young-adult life, daily grind, mental load, and soft relief. A feeling of clocking out from the world and arriving somewhere safe and peaceful. Not euphoric or dramatic — a subtle, confident smile and a sense of belonging.
